
Changes and new features in v0.7.0:
----------------------------------

-A new example application: "Showcase of Features".
The application is written using Gowut (of course) and showcases the component library.
You can start it by typing (from the root of your GOPATH):
go run src/code.google.com/p/gowut/examples/showcase.go

-New component: Expander
Expander shows and hides a content component when clicking on the header component.

-A new TableView interface which defines methods associated with a component rendered into a table.
Allows changing border, cell spacing, cell padding and default horizontal and vertical alignment for example.
Used for: Panel, Table, TabPanel (and TabBar)

-Added many new methods and constants to the style builder.

-Panel improvements:
* Constructors to create panels initialized with a different layout, e.g. NewHorizontalPanel().
* New helper methods to add space consumer components.
* New methods as part of the TableView.

-Changed CSS styles (beautified) of many components.

-CheckBox and RadioButton now have additional style classes for the disabled state.
