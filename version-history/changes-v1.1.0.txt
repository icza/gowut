
Changes and new features in v1.1.0:
----------------------------------

-A new SessMonitor component which can be used to monitor and display session timeout and network connectivity at the client side without interacting with the session.

-New method in Server: SetAppRootHandler().
With this you can now set your own logic to provide response to the app root path (when no window name is specified).
The default function renders the window list, including authenticated windows and session creators - with clickable links.

-New method in Window: RemoveHeadHtml() which removes an HTML head text that was previously added with AddHeadHtml().

-New methods in Server: AddRootHeadHtml() and RemoveRootHeadHtml().
These are similar to Window.AddHeadHtml() and Window.RemoveHeadHtml(), but these relate to extra head HTML text that are rendered for the window list page (app root).

-Showcase of feature demo app improvements.

-Other minor changes, improvements and optimization.
